# Will Byars

Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio. I'm a Quality Assurance Analyst with a passion for digital content and web development. I work for the Royal College of Nursing where I've had the opportunity to create digital content for members and improve their experiences with our website. In the [Projects](/projects) section there are examples of various digital projects I've worked on, mainly from when I worked as a Content Editor.

In my spare time I enjoy learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I also created my own music blog app called [**Realm 87**](https://www.realm87.com) using Next.js and React.
