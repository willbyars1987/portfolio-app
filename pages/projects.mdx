# Projects

<strong>
  Below are some examples of digital projects I have worked on. In each
  instance, I looked for gaps in our online offering and created content to fill
  those gaps, with the aim of improving our member's digital experiences. I also
  used analytical tools like Google Analytics and Hotjar to better understand
  user journeys and trends.

I worked with the Professional Leads of the Counselling Service to produce a Mental Health and Wellbeing section for the website, providing a range of helpful guidance and support for members.

I produced online career guidance for nursing staff working in the independent sector, which is one of the RCN's key priorities.

I created members-only content to encourage joining the RCN. An example of this is a downloadable sample supporting statement to help nurses and midwives applying for jobs. When a member is logged in, they can download the sample PDF document.

I created a section for Nursing Support Workers to support their career development including a range of resources and guidance on different career pathways.

I created a webpage for members who are looking to improve their IT skills. I previously worked as a RCN Adviser, and from speaking to members I was aware that some struggled with IT systems. When I became a Content Editor, I took the opportunity to try and help with this by creating some online guidance and resources.
