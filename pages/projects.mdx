# Projects

<strong>
  Below are some examples of digital projects I have worked on. In each
  instance, I looked for gaps in our digital offering and created content to
  fill those gaps, with the aim of enhancing and improving our member's digital
  experiences.

I worked with the Professional Leads of the Counselling Service to produce a Mental Health and Wellbeing section for the website, providing a range of helpful guidance and support for members.

I produced online career guidance for nursing staff working in the independent sector, which is one of the RCN's key priorities.

I created members-only content to encourage joining the RCN. One example was a downloadable sample Supporting Statement to help nurses and midwives applying for jobs.

I created a webpage for members who are looking to improve their IT skills. I previously worked as a RCN Adviser, and from speaking to members I was aware that some struggled with IT systems. When I worked as a Content Editor I took the opportunity to try and help with this.
